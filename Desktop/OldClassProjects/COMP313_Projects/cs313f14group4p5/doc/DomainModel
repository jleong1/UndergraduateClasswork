For our initial model, we tried using GridView to create the grid that would be used as a playing
board. This turned out the be an ineffective method so we ended up scraping the idea and drawing
multiple rectangles using a 'for loop' to look like a grid. We used the State Design pattern which
was used to create the two states, vulnerable and protected, that the monster switches between. We
ended up keeping TouchMe.java (which incorporates other parts of the project) from the original
project, but modified it so that it would work with everything we added to the project.
