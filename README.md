# UndergraduateClasswork
The following repo is a collection of class examples, lessons, and work that I have done during my undergraduate career. 
It is not completely organized or complete.  In addition some work in this folder is to be accredited to the correct authors.  Not all work done here is done by me.  This repo is purely just for reference.
